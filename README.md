# REST_API_DEMO
Test task  Restful API
This is part of my graduation project to submit as a test. The subject area is as follows:

There are products containing some components (substances). 
The task of the application is to select a combination of different products in order to obtain a combination of given compounds (substances) with some additional options. 
An example of an area is dietetics, when a consumer needs to get a set of nutrients, vitamins and minerals from food and dietary supplement, but for example, with a minimum amount of calories. 

Another area is argonomy, when a farmer needs to select a set of nutrients using various fertilizers and at the same time minimize costs.

The given api performs only part of the tasks of the project.
